I'm excited to share that I've officially started my research stay at the University of Osaka as a visiting doctoral researcher! I kicked things off with a presentation about my research journey so far, and I'm looking forward to the productive months ahead.
I'm deeply grateful to Prof. Okura and Prof. Santo here at Osaka for welcoming me and making this opportunity possible. I also want to thank my supervisors at the University of Bonn, Prof. Behnke and Dr. Zell, for their support in helping me pursue this stay. I'm looking forward to learning a lot during my time here.
